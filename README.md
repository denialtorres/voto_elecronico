# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* System dependencies

run `bundle install`

* Database creation

run `rake db:nuke`

Once inside vagrant run `cd /vagrant` and run `puma`.

Then you can go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

* How to run the test suite
